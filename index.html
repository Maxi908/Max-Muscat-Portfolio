                    <h1>Max Muscat</h1>
                    <p>As a Junior Web Developer, I am driven by a deep passion for web development and a
                        commitment to creating engaging digital experiences. Although I am early in my career, I have
                        honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js through hands-on projects and coursework.
                        My background in Writing and Visual Art allows me to approach web design with a creative and
                        detail-oriented mindset. I am enthusiastic about learning new technologies and am dedicated to
                        growing my expertise in front-end development.
                        I’m excited to contribute my enthusiasm and developing skills to collaborative projects and
                        I'm eager to tackle new challenges in the tech field.

            <p>I recently completed my first real-world website project for my dad's upcoming sculpture exhibition. He needed a site showcasing his recycled material sculptures, and it was the perfect opportunity for me to apply my web development skills. Despite some challenges, I learned valuable lessons about software updates, file extensions, and preparation. Along the way, I became familiar with tools like Netlify, DNS, and SEO best practices. I'm proud of the result, which received positive feedback, and I look forward to making future improvements. </p>

            <p>This was a group project where we created a To Do App using React. A key highlight for me was
                implementing a custom hook to display API data, marking my first experience with custom hooks.</p>

            <p>This project involved creating a website based on the redline provided as part of the Learn Intermediate
                CSS Course on Codecademy. For the site, I had the choice of using opacity for the font but I thought
                that bolded text without it looked better as it stood out against the black background and made it
                easier to read.</p>

            <p>This project involed fixing a website by debugging and restructuring code to restore functionality as
                part of a Codecademy course. I made improvements, added comments for clarity, and used Google's
                'Inspect' tool to ensure alignment with the desired layout. This project improved my debugging skills
                and understanding of website functionality and responsive design.</p>

            <p>I built a user-friendly Pokémon Generator as part of my introduction to JavaScript, following a YouTube
                tutorial by BroCode. Users can input a Pokémon name to see an image displayed, showcasing my ability to
                create interactive web applications with basic JavaScript functionality. I included some styling but
                kept it simple, focusing primarily on getting familiar with fetching data from an API using JavaScript.
